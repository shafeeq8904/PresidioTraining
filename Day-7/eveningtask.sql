-- transactions
-- 1) write a transaction that inserts a new customer, adds their rental, and logs the payment â€“ all atomically.
begin;

    insert into customer (store_id, first_name, last_name, email, address_id, active, create_date)

select customer_id, 1, rental_id, 4.99, now() from new_rental;
commit;

select * from customer order by customer_id desc;
select * from payment order by customer_id desc;
rollback;

-- 2) simulate a transaction where one update fails (e.g., invalid rental id), and ensure the entire transaction rolls back.
do $$

update payment set amount = amount + 5 where payment_id = 17508;

commit;

select * from payment where payment_id in (17507, 17508);

-- 4) perform a transaction that transfers inventory from one store to another (delete + insert) safely.
begin;

    delete from rental where inventory_id = 1001;

insert into inventory (film_id, store_id, last_update)

-- 5) create a transaction that deletes a customer and all associated records (rental, payment), ensuring referential integrity.
begin;
delete from payment where customer_id = 524;
delete from rental where customer_id = 524;
delete from customer where customer_id = 524;
