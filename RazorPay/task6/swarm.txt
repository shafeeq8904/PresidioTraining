Create a file called docker-compose.yml

version: "3.8"

services:
  nginx-web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 3
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure

 Initialize Docker Swarm (only once)
docker swarm init

Run the following command inside the folder where docker-compose.yml is located:
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml nginx-stack


 Check Running Services
docker service ls

Expected output:

NAME                    MODE        REPLICAS  IMAGE
nginx-stack_nginx-web   replicated  3/3       nginx:latest


View Tasks (Replicas)
docker service ps nginx-stack_nginx-web


Remove the stack
docker stack rm nginx-stack

Leave Swarm mode
docker swarm leave --force
